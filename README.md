# advent_of_code
A copy of my advent of code solutions minus the puzzle inputs. Written in Rust as a learning exercise. Quick solutions, not necessarily the most elegant. There is almost no error handling considering that the puzzle input is fixed.

It's maybe not the best Rust, but I'm still learning the language, and hopefully it's getting better. I find Rust ideal for these coding challengea, it is both expressive and efficient, and really cool in general!

Each solution is in YYYY/dayDD. cd into the directory, then run using cargo and piping in the puzzle input text, for example

```
cat input | cargo run --release
```
